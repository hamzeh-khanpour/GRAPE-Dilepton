<< Introduction >>
 In order to compile the source code, the following libraries are needed.

    libbases.a  : for MC integrations and event generations (BASES/SPRING)
    libchanel.a : for amplitude calculations (CHANEL library)
    libkinem.a  : for kinematics calculations
    libpdflib.a, libmathlib.a, libpacklib.a and libpythia61??.a (from CERNLIB)

 The libraries: libbases.a, libchanel.a, libkinem.a and the SOPHIA program are
 included in this program package.  Only the libraries from CERNLIB have to be
 prepared by users.  libbases.a and the SOPHIA code were slightly modified,
 so that the corresponding original versions of the programs must not be
 linked to GRAPE-Dilepton.  The GRAPE-Dilepton program had been checked mainly
 with PYTHIA6115.  If you find problems with higher versions (before v6.2),
 please inform me (tabe@post.kek.jp).

 The latest information is available from the following web page.

<< Compiling procedure >>
 Here it is assumed that users are using UNIX with (t)csh.
 In the following instruction, '%' indicates a UNIX prompt.

    (1) Copy the source code archive file ([*].tar}) into your directory.
    (2) % tar xvf [*].tar
    (3) % cd [*]
(Compiling BASES/SPRING...)
    (4) % cd basesv5.1
    (5) Modify 'Makefile' for your system.
    (6) % make
          (---> '../lib/libbases.a' is created.)
(Compiling the CHANEL library...)
    (7) % cd ../chanel
    (8) Modify 'Makefile' for your system.
    (9) % make
          (---> '../lib/libchanel.a' is created.)
(Compiling the KINEMATICS library...)
   (10) % cd ../kinemlib
   (11) % Modify 'Makefile' for your system.
   (12) % make
          (---> '../lib/libkinem.a' is created.)
   (13) % cd ..
(Compiling the GRAPE-Dilepton source code...)
   (14) % cd src
   (15) Modify 'set_grape' for your system.
   (16) % source set_grape
   (17) % make integ
          (---> './integ' is created.)
   (18) % make spring
          (---> './spring' is created.)
(END of compiling)


<< How to run the executables >>
  (1) Copy the files: 'integ', 'spring' and 'grape.cards' into your directory.
  (2) Edit the file 'grape.cards' for your purpose.
  (3) Run 'integ'.  (---> './grape.cards' is read by 'integ'.)
  (4) After the execution of 'integ', run 'spring'.
        (---> './grape.cards' and './bases.rz' are read by 'spring'.)
(END of run)
